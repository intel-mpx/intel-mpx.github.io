## Latency and Throughput of MPX Instructions  {#mpxinstr}

The following table shows the latency-throughput results of Intel MPX instructions.

In our extension, we wrote a loop with 1,000 copies of an instruction under test and run the loop 100 times. This gives us 100,000 executions in total. We run each experiment 10 times to make sure the results were not influenced by external factors.
For each run, we initialize all BND registers with dummy values to avoid interrupts caused by failed bound checks.

{% include alert text='**Note 1**: `bndcu` has a oneâ€™s complement version `bndcn`, we skip it for clarity.' %}

{% include alert text='**Note 2**: Ideally, we would measure latency for the *serial case*. However, we were not able to create a data dependency for MPX instructions. Therefore, we resorted to estimating latency based on our microbenchmarks and Intel documentation (i.e., it is our educated guess).' %}

{% include alert text='**Note 3**: For our Skylake, ports P0, P1, P5, and P6 are arithmetic/logic units, P2 and P3 are load and address-generation units, P4 is a store unit, and P7 is load/store address-generation unit.' %}

Let us look at `bndmk b, m` first.
The instruction creates bounds based on the `m` second operand and puts them in a `b` bounds register (note that `m` in this case is not an actual memory access, but a LEA-like expression).
Each `bndmk` instruction is split into two micro-operations (&mu;ops).
In one cycle, two `bndmk`s can be executed in parallel, i.e., throughput is 2.
This also implies there are four &mu;ops per cycle: two &mu;ops of one `bndmk` are executed in parallel on P0 and P1, and two other &mu;ops of another `bndmk`---on P5 and P6.
The ports' columns show their utilization; in this case, P0, P1, P5, and P6 are 100% utilized.
Note how P2-P4---ports to access memory---are not used by this instruction.
Finally, the latency of `bndmk` is one cycle since two &mu;ops can be executed in parallel.

For another example, consider `bndcl b, m`.
Its throughput is only one instruction/cycle, and the bottleneck is P1.
P0 and P7 have only 50% utilization, i.e., they execute one &mu;op in one cycle and then stall for another cycle, waiting for P1.
Note how `bndcl b, r` version of the same instruction achieves two instructions/cycle because it does not use P1.

Final example is `bndldx b, m`.
The instruction loads bounds into `b` from a memory location derived from address `m` (from a bounds table).
This complex instruction is composed of 8 &mu;ops occupying 6 ports and has a low throughput of around 0.4 instructions/cycle ([Storing bounds in memory](/design#boundstore) explains why it is so complicated).
We estimate the latency of `bndldx` as taking 4 to 6 cycles, with a bottleneck of loading from memory (ports P2 and P3).
Moreover, since it uses most of the available ports, it may hinder scalability when hyperthreading is used.

In general, most operations have latencies of one cycle, e.g., the most frequently used `bndcl` and `bndcu`.
The serious bottleneck is storing/loading the bounds with `bndstx` and `bndldx` since they undergo a complex algorithm of accessing bounds tables.

## Overhead of MPX checks  {#mpxchecks}

In our experiments, we observed that MPX protection does *not* increase the IPC (instructions/cycle) of programs, which is usually the case for memory-safety techniques (see our [IPC evaluation](/performance#ipc)).
This was surprising: we expected that MPX would increase IPC of programs with low original IPC, i.e., it would take advantage of the underutilized CPU resources.

To understand what causes this bottleneck, we measured the throughput of typical MPX check sequences using the same framework as above.
We originally blamed an unjustified data dependency between `bndcl`, `bndcu`, and the protected memory access; this speculation turned out to be incorrect.

Here are the throughput measurements:

| `bndcl m` + `bndcu m` +         | `store`    | 1.5  |   | both-bounds LEA-style check, **frequent**

{% include alert text='**Note**: It is crucial to distinguish two types of operands used in bounds checking: direct memory address (`r` or register operand) and relative LEA-style addresses(`m` or memory operands). In assembly, the first one looks like this: `bndcl %rax,%bnd0`---it takes the address in `rax`, compares it with the lower bound of `bnd0` and rises a _#BR_ exception if it violates the bound. This instruction consist of one comparison and maps to a single micro-operation. The second type is more complex: `bndcl  (%rax,%rbx,4),%bnd0`. First, the address has to be calculated by multiplying `rbx` by 4 and then adding `rax`. Only afterwards can the resulting address be checked against the lower bound of `bnd0`. Accordingly, it requires one more micro-operation to calculate the address and, as we can see from [the table in the previous section](/microbenchmarks#mpxinstr), it can be executed only on port 1.' %}

The table highlights a bottleneck of `bndcl m` and `bndcu m` (due to contention on port P1).
Let's first consider checks before loads and then before stores.

In case of loads, the original program can execute two loads in parallel, achieving a throughput of 2 IPC (note that the loaded data is always in a Memory Ordering Buffer).
Under MPX, the load can be prepended with a single-bound check---which can happen in case of loop optimizations, but is very rare in reality.
If this single-bound check is `bndcl r`, then IPC doubles: two loads and two bounds-checks can be executed in parallel because they do not share ports.
However, if the check is `bndcl m`, then IPC *stays the same (two)*: only one load and one bounds-check can execute in one cycle since `bndcl m` contends on P1.
The typical case is when MPX inserts two bounds checks.
In this case, for `r` checks, IPC increases to three instructions per cycle: one load, one lower-, and one upper-bound check per cycle.
For `m` checks, IPC becomes *less* than the original: two loads and four checks are scheduled in four cycles, thus IPC of 1.5.
These scenarious are illustrated by the following figure:

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<img class="t20" width="80%" src="{{ site.urlimg }}mpx_checks.jpg" alt="Bottleneck of bounds checking">
</div>

The similar analysis applies for stores.
However, the original IPC in this case is *one* store per cycle, which means that any variant of MPX checks *increases* IPC.

In summary, since loads usually dominate memory accesses, and both-bounds checks dominate MPX instrumentation, the final IPC is around 1.5-3.
In comparison to original IPC of 2 loads/cycle, the MPX-protected program has approximately the same IPC.

As our [performance measurements](/performance/) show, it causes major performance degradation.
It can be fixed, however; if the next generations of CPUs will provide the relative memory address calculation on other ports, the checks could be parallelized and performance will improve.
We can speculate that GCC-MPX could reach the results of AddressSanitizer in this case, because the instruction overheads are similar. 
Accordingly, ICC version would be even better and the slowdowns might drop lower than 20%.
But we must note that we do not have any hard proof for this speculation.

## OS Bounds Tables Overhead  {#os}

Intel MPX relies on the operating system to manage special Bounds Tables (BTs) that hold pointer metadata.
To illustrate the additional overhead of allocating and de-allocating BTs, two microbenchmarks showcase the worst case scenarios.
The source code for them [can be found here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/table_allocation.c).

The first microbenchmark stores a large set of pointers in such memory locations that each of them will have a separate BT, i.e., this benchmark indirectly creates a huge amount of bounds tables.
The second one does the same, but additionally frees all the memory right after it has been assigned, thus triggering BT de-allocation.

The characteristics of microbenchmarks:

* working with 3,000 BTs
* average over 10 runs
* compilation flags:
  * native version: `-g -O0`
  * MPX version: `-mmpx -fcheck-pointer-bounds -lmpx -lmpxwrappers -g -O0`

Note that we disabled all compiler optimizations to showcase the influence of OS alone.

The following table shows the impact of OS managing BTs, i.e., overheads of MPX version in performance and number of instructions w.r.t. native.

|                              | Perf   | Instr in user space  | Instr in kernel space |
|:-----------------------------|-------:|---------------------:|----------------------:|
| Only allocation              | 2.33Ã—  | 7.5%                 | 160%                  |
| Allocation and de-allocation | 2.25Ã—  | 10%                  | 139%                  |

In both cases, most of the runtime parameters (cache locality, branch misses, etc.) of the MPX-protected version are equivalent to the native one.
However, the performance overhead is noticeable -- more than 2 times.
It is caused by a single parameter that varies -- the number of instructions executed in the kernel space.
(Note how the number of instructions executed in the user space increases only slightly.)
It means that the overhead is caused purely by the BT management in the kernel.

We conclude that OS can account for performance overhead of 2.3Ã— in the worst case.

More statistics collected can be found here: [os_microbenchmark.md]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/os_microbenchmark.md).

## Performance microbenchmarks  {#performance}

Below are the four microbenchmarks, each highlighting a separate MPX feature:

* [arraywrite]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/arraywrite.c): writing to memory (stress `bndcl` and `bndcu`)
* [arrayread]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/arrayread.c): reading from memory (stress `bndcl` and `bndcu`)
* [struct]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/struct.c): writing in an inner array inside a struct (the bounds-narrowing feature via `bndmk` and `bndmov`)
* [ptrcreation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/ptrcreation.c): assigning new values to pointers (stress `bndstx`)

All microbenchmarks were compiled with `-O2` optimizations.

Performance results:

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<img class="t20" width="60%" src="{{ site.urlimg }}micro_perf.jpg" alt="Performance overheads of microbenchmarks">
</div>

**Observation 1**: `arraywrite` and `arrayread` represent the bare overhead of bounds-checking instructions (all in registers), 50% in this case. `struct` has a higher overhead of 2.1âˆ’2.8Ã— due to the more expensive making and moving of bounds to and from the stack. 5Ã— overhead of `ptrcreation` is due to storing of bounds -- the most expensive MPX operation.

**Observation 2**:
There is a 25% difference between GCC and ICC in `arraywrite`. This is the effect of optimizations: GCCâ€™s MPX pass blocks loop unrolling while ICCâ€™s implementation takes  advantage of it. (Interestingly, the same happened in case of `arrayread` but the native ICC version was optimized even better, which led to a relatively poor performance of ICCâ€™s MPX.)

**Observation 3**:
The overhead of `arrayread` becomes negligible with the only-writes MPX version: the only memory accesses in this benchmark are reads which are left uninstrumented. The same logic applies to `struct` -- disabling narrowing of bounds effectively removes expensive `bndmk` and `bndmov` instructions and lowers performance overhead to a bare minimum.

## Multithreading microbenchmark  {#multithreading}

Intel MPX has fundamental problems with multithreading support.
In a nutshell, the problem arises because of the **non-atomic** way MPX loads and stores pointer bounds via its `bndldx` and `bndstx` instructions whenever a real pointer is loaded/stored from/to memory.
More information is provided in our paper[^mpxexplained] and in other sources[^chisnall].

We constructed two test cases that break MPX in a multithreaded environment: one that leads to a *false positive* (false alarm) and one that leads to a *false negative* (undetected real bug).
The test cases roughly work as follows; see our paper for more details.
A "pointer bounds" data race happens on the `arr` array of pointers. The background thread fills this array with all pointers to the first or to the second object alternately. Meanwhile, the main thread accesses a whatever object is currently pointed-to by the array items. Note that depending on the value of the constant offset, the original program is either always-correct or always-buggy: if offset is zero, then the main thread always accesses the correct object, otherwise it accesses an incorrect, adjacent object.

The test cases are compiled and run as follows:

* false negative:
  * [source code]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/multithreading_fn.c)
  * compile at `-O1` to have simple non-vectorized asm
  * run with `CHKP_RT_MODE=count CHKP_RT_PRINT_SUMMARY=1 CHKP_RT_VERBOSE=0 ./gcc_mpx/multithreading_fn`
  * Results:
    * in *correct* MPX implementation, output must be *10,000,000* (`ITERATIONS*MAXSIZE`)
    * in current GCC and ICC implementations, output is **less** than 10,000,000 (due to broken multithreading)
* false positive:
  * [source code]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/code/multithreading_fp.c)
  * compile at `-O1` to have simple non-vectorized asm
  * run with `CHKP_RT_MODE=count CHKP_RT_PRINT_SUMMARY=1 CHKP_RT_VERBOSE=0 ./gcc_mpx/multithreading_fp`
  * Results:
    * in *correct* MPX implementation, no `#BR` exception must be output
    * in current GCC and ICC implementations, output is `#BR` exception **nondetermenistically** (due to broken multithreading)

{% include alert text='**Note**: Make sure the test cases run on two cores!' %}
